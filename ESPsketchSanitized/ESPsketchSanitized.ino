/*
This is the code for the ESP8266 portion of my v2.0 mailbox delivery notification system. 

Note: I've removed all the unnecessary serial output that was used for debugging. 

The ESP8266 (a Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev in my case) is used to get sensor readings and send a mail delivery notification. Most of the code here was pulled from various Arduino examples. 

I didn't want to rely on external services to send notifications. After much finagling, I found that using my own internal SMTP server (Postfix, not publicly exposed, it relays through Gmail) was the simplest. If you've ever sent an email by telnetting into an SMTP server, this will look familiar to you. 

All functionality occurs during setup, the Loop is empty. After running the necessary functions to read sensors, connect to wifi, and send the email, the ESP8266 goes into deepSleep 
indefinitely. It's woken up by a reset preformed by an ATtiny85.

In testing I found that the ESP8266 has issues re-connecting to wifi after waking up (i.e. being reset). To remedy this, when the ESP8266 wakes up it immediately disconnects from 
wifi - WiFi.disconnect(); - and then reconnects when necessary. Also, the ESP8266 connects a tiny bit faster when you give it a static IP, vs. waiting for a DHCP lease. A static IP may not be
suable for all environments, however. 

The entire setup, including solar charge controller, uses only 0.4mA when sleeping. At its most active (WiFi is in use) the system peaks at 126mA, but this is very brief. When the system is 
sleeping, but the notification LEDs are on, usage is 48.7mA.

The ADC in the ESP8266 is tricky (inaccurate?) which is why I map the reading - BatteryPINreading = map(BatteryPINreading, 0, 934, 0, 100); - to 934 to reflect a full battery, rather than 
closer to the 1023 it should be given that I'm feeding it near the 1v max input. On the Adafruit ESP8266 Huzzah the readings were even more off. This seems to be a known issue with the 
ESP8266 so the best solution is to read the values your ADC is giving you and parse them apropreatly.
